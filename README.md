Project: Faculty Selection Process and Data Maintenance

-> Faculty Recruitment is a process of appointing teaching candidates in a particular school or college. The main goal of all the schools and colleges is to hire the best faculty possible for giving the best education to the students. These teaching faculties are appointed as per their qualifications and experience. With the growing amount of digital content, automation has become an important need. The process of validating a large number of user information is a task suited for automation. The objective of this project is to build software that can enable selectors to identify, evaluate and recruit.

-> The recruiters can publish available vacant posts thereby enabling people to apply for the particular post and submit their data and other relevant information. The software then stores them. It then processes the submitted data and validates them. The recruiters can view whether the given faculty has passed the given criteria and provide feedback.

-> To develop this project, we will be adopting Agile methodology to incrementally build our project in the form of combining various software modules throughout sprints. These phases will include communication, planning, modeling, construction, and testing phases. Once the module is built and tested successfully, it will be reviewed to assess whether it meets the necessary specifications and requirements. If the required standards are met, they will be deployed and hosted in containers to add them to our existing modules
